## Item Structure and Metadata

Each item in the Marketplace requires specific metadata files and follows a consistent directory structure.

### Directory Structure

The basic structure for a package is:

```
package-name/
â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.en.yml       # Required metadata file (English)
â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.fr.yml       # Optional localized metadata (French)
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md             # Documentation for the package
â”œâ”€â”€ modes/                # Directory for mode components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ my-mode/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ metadata.en.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ mcp servers/          # Directory for MCP server components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ my-server/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ metadata.en.yml
â””â”€â”€ prompts/              # Directory for prompt components
    â””â”€â”€ my-prompt/
        â””â”€â”€ metadata.en.yml
```

### Metadata File Format

Metadata files use YAML format and must include specific fields:

```yaml
name: "My Package"
description: "A detailed description of what this package does"
version: "1.0.0"
type: "package" # One of: package, mode, mcp server, prompt
tags:
    - tag1
    - tag2
items: # Only for packages AND when a subcomponent isn't located in the packages directory tree
    - type: "prompt"
      path: "../shared-prompts/data-analysis" # Reference to component outside package directory
author: "your name" # optional
authorUrl: "http://your.profile.url/" #optional
```

### Package Example in Source Tree

Here's how a package might look in the actual source tree:

```
Roo-Code-Packages/
â”œâ”€â”€ shared-prompts/                # Shared prompts directory
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ data-analysis/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ metadata.en.yml
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ data-toolkit/                  # Your package directory
    â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.en.yml            # Package metadata
    â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.fr.yml            # Localized metadata
    â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                  # Documentation
    â”œâ”€â”€ modes/                     # Modes directory
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ data-analyst/
    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ metadata.en.yml
    â””â”€â”€ mcp servers/               # MCP servers directory
        â””â”€â”€ data-processor/
            â””â”€â”€ metadata.en.yml
```

### Required Fields

- **name**: A clear, descriptive name for your component
- **description**: A detailed explanation of what your component does
- **version**: Semantic version number (e.g., "1.0.0")
- **type**: Component type (one of: "package", "mode", "mcp server", "prompt")
- **tags**: (Optional) Array of relevant tags for filtering
- **items**: (Only for packages) Array of subcomponents with their type and path - when the path is not in the packages directory
 tree
- **author**: Your name
- **authorUrl**: A proile Url that you want people to see. GitHub profile, or linked-in profile for example
- **sourceUrl**: optional destination Url to your item's source if you haven't included it directly in the Marketplace.

### The Items Array and External References

The `items` array in a package's metadata serves only one important purposes:

**External Component References**: It allows referencing components that exist outside the package's directory tree.

Components that are within the package's directory tree are implicitly included and will be found at runtime.

#### Referencing External Components

You can reference components from anywhere in the repository by using relative paths:

```yaml
items:
    # Component within the package directory
    - type: "mode"
      path: "modes/my-mode"

    # Component outside the package directory (using relative path)
    - type: "prompt"
      path: "../shared-prompts/data-analysis"

    # Component from a completely different part of the repository
    - type: "mcp server"
      path: "../../other-category/useful-server"
```

This allows you to:

- Create shared components that can be used by multiple packages
- Organize components logically while maintaining package relationships
- Reference existing components without duplicating them

#### How It Works

- The `path` is relative to the package's directory
- The Marketplace resolves these paths when loading the package
- Components referenced this way appear as part of the package in the UI
- The same component can be included in multiple packages

### Localization Support

You can provide metadata in multiple languages by using locale-specific files:

**Important Notes on Localization:**

- Only files with the pattern `metadata.{locale}.yml` are supported
- The Marketplace will display metadata in the user's locale if available
- If the user's locale is not available, it will fall back to English
- The English locale (`metadata.en.yml`) is required as a fallback
- Files without a locale code (e.g., just `metadata.yml`) are not supported

## Contributing Process

To contribute your package to the official repository, follow these steps:

### 1. Fork the Repository

1. Visit the official Roo Code Packages repository: [https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code-Marketplace](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code-Marketplace)

# Adding Custom Marketplace Sources

The Marketplace allows you to extend its functionality by adding custom sources. This guide explains how to set up and manage your own Marktplace repositories to access additional components beyond the default offerings.

## Setting up a Marketplace Source Repository

A Marketplace source repository is a Git repository that contains Marketplace items organized in a specific structure. You can create your own repository to host custom packages:

### Repository Requirements

1. **Proper Structure**: The repository must follow the required directory structure
2. **Valid Metadata**: Each package must include properly formatted metadata files
3. **Git Repository**: The source must be a Git repository accessible via HTTPS

### Creating a New Repository

1. Create a new repository on GitHub, GitLab, or another Git hosting service
2. Initialize the repository with a README.md file
3. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-package-repo.git
cd your-package-repo
```

4. Create the basic repository structure:

```bash
mkdir -p packages modes "mcp servers" prompts
touch metadata.en.yml
```

5. Add repository metadata to `metadata.en.yml`:

```yaml
name: "Your Repository Name"
description: "A collection of custom packages for Roo Code"
version: "1.0.0"
```

6. Commit and push the initial structure:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initialize package repository structure"
git push origin main
```

## Required Structure and Metadata

A source repository must follow a specific structure to be properly recognized by the Marketplace:

### Repository Structure

```
repository-root/
â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.en.yml           # Repository metadata
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                 # Repository documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/                 # Directory for package components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package-1/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.en.yml   # Package metadata
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ package-2/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.en.yml
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ modes/                    # Directory for mode components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ custom-mode/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ metadata.en.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ mcp servers/              # Directory for MCP server components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ custom-server/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ metadata.en.yml
â””â”€â”€ prompts/                  # Directory for prompt components
    â””â”€â”€ custom-prompt/
        â””â”€â”€ metadata.en.yml
```

### Repository Metadata

The root `metadata.en.yml` file describes the repository itself:

```yaml
name: "Custom Roopository"
description: "A collection of specialized components for data science workflows"
version: "1.0.0"
author: "Your Name or Organization"
tags:
    - custom
    - data-science
```

### Item Organization

- Item should be organized by type in their respective directories
- Each item must have its own directory containing a metadata file
- Items can be nested within packages as subcomponents
- Follow the same structure as described in [Adding Packages](./05-adding-packages.md)

## Adding Sources to Roo Code

Once you have a properly structured source repository, you can add it to your Roo Code Marketplace as a source:

### Default Package Source

Roo Code comes with a default package source:

- URL: `https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code-Marketplace`
- This source is enabled by default, and anytime all sources have been deleted.

### Adding a New Source

1. Open VS Code with the Roo Code extension
2. Navigate to the Marketplace
3. Switch to the "Sources" tab
4. Click the "Add Source" button
5. Enter the repository URL:
    - Format: `https://github.com/username/repository.git`
    - Example: `https://github.com/your-username/your-package-repo.git`
6. Click "Add" to save the source

### Managing Sources

The "Sources" tab provides several options for managing your package sources:

1. **Remove**: Delete a source from your configuration
2. **Refresh**: Update the item list from a sources - this is forced git clone/pull to override local caching of data

### Source Caching and Refreshing

Marketplace sources are cached to improve performance:

- **Cache Duration**: Sources are cached for 1 hour (3600000 ms)
- **Force Refresh**: To force an immediate refresh of a source:
    1. Go to the "Sources" tab
    2. Click the "Refresh" button next to the source you want to update
    3. This will bypass the cache and fetch the latest data from the repository

### Troubleshooting Sources

If a source isn't loading properly:

1. Check that the repository URL is correct
2. Ensure the repository follows the required structure
3. Look for error messages in the Marketplace interface
4. Try refreshing the sources list
5. Disable and re-enable the source

## Creating Private Sources

For team or organization use, you might want to create private sources:

### Private Repository Setup

1. Create a private repository on your Git hosting service
2. Follow the same structure requirements as public repositories
3. Set up appropriate access controls for your team members

### Authentication Options

To access private repositories, you may need to:

1. Configure Git credentials on your system
2. Use a personal access token with appropriate permissions
3. Set up SSH keys for authentication

### Organization Best Practices

For teams and organizations:

1. Designate maintainers responsible for the source
2. Establish quality standards for contributed items and packages
3. Create a review process for new additions
4. Document usage guidelines for team members
5. Consider implementing versioning for your items and packages

## Using Multiple Sources

The Marketplace supports multiple sources simultaneously:

### Benefits of Multiple Sources

- Access components from different providers
- Separate internal and external components
- Test new work before contributing them to the main repository
- Create specialized sources for different projects or teams

### Source Management Strategy

1. Keep the default source enabled for core components
2. Add specialized sources for specific needs
3. Create a personal source for testing and development
4. Refresh sources after you've pushed changes to them to get the latest items
